# CVE Report

This repository contains a script to analyze vulnerabilities from a JSON data file and generate detailed report.

## Overview

The `CVEReport` class handles the entire process of generating a vulnerability report. It reads data from a JSON file, processes it to extract relevant information into a CSV file, and outputs the insights into an Excel report.

## Files

- `vuln_data.json`: JSON data containing vulnerability information.
- `CVE_Details.csv`: The CSV file where the data is parsed and stored. This file is used to generate insights.
- `CVE Report.xlsx`: The final report containing multiple sheets with detailed insights.

## Report Details

The `CVE Report.xlsx` file contains the following sheets, each providing specific details:

1. **Total Vulnerabilities**: Total number of vulnerabilities across all images.
2. **Total Unique Vulnerabilities**: Number of unique vulnerabilities (distinct CVE IDs).
3. **Vulnerabilities by BaseImage**: Breakdown of total number of vulnerabilities and number of unique vulnerabilities by base image.
4. **Unique vulns Image&Severity**: Breakdown of the number of unique vulnerabilities by image and severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
5. **Product Fix Versions**: List of all unique products and their respective fix versions.
6. **Vulns by Product&BaseImage**: Breakdown showing the number of unique vulnerabilities by product and base image.
7. **Priority Scores**: Provides scores for each image name based on the severity of unique vulnerabilities. Calculated by weighting severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, and Low.
8. **CVE Description**: Detailed descriptions of each CVE, including additional metadata fetched from OpenCVE API.

## Usage

1. **Setup:** Create a `.env` file and define the environment variables necessary for OpenCVE API authentication:
   ```sh
   OPENCVE_USERNAME=your_username
   OPENCVE_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages.
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Script:** Execute the script to generate the report.
   ```sh
   python cve_report.py
   ```
